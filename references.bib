  abstract={The command mundlak estimates random-effects regression models (xtreg, re) adding group-means of variables in indepvars which vary within groups. This technique was proposed by Mundlak (1978) as a way to relax the assumption in the random-effects estimator that the observed variables are uncorrelated with the unobserved variables. Additionally, the degree of statistical significance of the estimated coefficients on the group means can be used to test whether such assumption holds for individual regressors. See also Chapter 10 in Wooldridge (2010) and Chapter 11 in Greene (2011).},

  abstract = {One typically analyzes clustered data using random- or fixed-effects models. Fixed-effects models allow consistent estimation of the effects of level-one variables, even if there is unobserved heterogeneity at level two. However, these models cannot estimate the effects of level-two variables. Hybrid and correlated random-effects models are flexible modeling specifications that separate within-and between-cluster effects and allow for both consistent estimation of level-one effects and inclusion of level-two variables. In this article, we elaborate on the separation of within- and between-cluster effects in generalized linear mixed models. These models present a unifying framework for an entire class of models whose response variables follow a distribution from the exponential family (for example, linear, logit, probit, ordered probit and logit, Poisson, and negative binomial models). We introduce the user-written command xthybrid, a shell for the meglm command. xthybrid can fit a variety of hybrid and correlated random-effects models.}

I allow for general staggered interventions, with and without covariates. Under an index version of parallel trends, I show that average treatment effects on the treated (ATTs) are identified for each cohort and calendar time period in which a cohort was subjected to the intervention. The pooled quasi-maximum likelihood estimators in the linear exponential family extend pooled ordinary least squares estimation of linear models. By using the conditional mean associated with the canonical link function, imputation and pooling across the entire sample produce identical estimates. Generally, pooled estimation results in very simple computation of the ATTs and their standard errors. The leading cases are a logit functional form for binary and fractional outcomes—combined with the Bernoulli quasi-log likelihood (QLL)—and an exponential mean combined with the Poisson QLL.}",

While the approach is computationally intensive, the hardware requirements for the fitting are minimal, allowing for estimation in models with multiple high-order fixed effects for large datasets. I illustrate implementing this approach using the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey data with four fixed effects. I also present a new Stata command, regxfe, for implementing this strategy.},

	journal = {Unpublished Manuscript},
	abstract = {I propose a feasible and computationally efficient estimator of linear models with multiple levels of fixed effects. First, I show that solving the two–way fixed effects model is equivalent to solving a linear system on a weighted graph, and apply recent advances in spectral graph theory to obtain a nearly–linear time estimator (Kelner et al, 2013). Second, I embed this estimator into an improved version of the generalized within–estimator of Guimarães and Portugal (2010) and Gaure (2013), replacing their projections with symmetric ones amenable to conjugate gradient acceleration, guaranteeing monotonic convergence. The proposed estimator has the fastest known asymptotic running time, and performs particularly well with large datasets and high–dimensional fixed effects. Morever, by combining insights from graph theory, it opens the door to further improvements on the estimation and inference of models with multi–way fixed effects.},
