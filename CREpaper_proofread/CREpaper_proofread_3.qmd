[TextBlock(text='<edited_text>\nSince the equivalence between FE and CRE has been shown for linear models, we focus on the performance of the `cre` in the context of non-linear models. For this, we consider 4 different models: probit, fractional regression probit, tobit, and poisson. \n\nFor each one, the data generating process is as follows:\n\n```\n// probit\ngen y_probit = 1*(y_star-1+rnormal()>0)\n// fractional probit\ngen y_fprobit = normal(y_star-1+rnormal())\n// tobit\ngen y_tobit = max( y_star + rnormal(),0)\n// poisson\ngen y_poisson = rpoisson(exp(y_star))\n```\n\nWe then estimate the models under three assumptions: one where the fixed effects are observed including `c1` and `c2` in the specification (benchmark), one where they are not considered, and one where we use the CRE approach using the `cre` command. This exercise is repeated 1000 times, and the results are compared in terms of the distributions of the marginal effects for the probit and fractional probit model, and coefficients for the tobit and poisson models, under the three scenarios. We use `parallel`[@vegayon2019] to speed up the process. \n\nThe results of the simulation are presented in @fig-cre and @tbl-cre. The figure presents the densities of the estimated coefficients across all simulations, whereas the table provides a brief summary of the bias and mean absolute error of the estimated coefficients. \n\n:::{#fig-cre fig-pos="H"}\n\n![](simulation/fig1.png)\n\nEstimated marginal effects/Coefficient densities for non-linear models\n:::\n\nAs expected, controlling for the unobserved effects, the unfeasible estimator provides what we would consider to be the benchmark/true estimates of coefficients/marginal effects given the sample and data generating process. For @tbl-cre, we use the mean of the unfeasible estimator to represent the true point estimate and construct the bias and mean absolute error for the other estimators.\n\nBecause the individual effects are constructed to be correlated with the explanatory variables, the estimated coefficients are biased when they are ignored, and coefficients are estimated using pooled estimators. The magnitude of the bias is approximately 12-13% with respect to the point estimate of the coefficient or marginal effect.\n\nOn the other hand, the CRE approach seems to provide consistent estimates for the coefficients/marginal effects, with a distribution that is centered around the true point estimate, with slightly higher variance than the benchmark. Based on the results from @tbl-cre, the bias of the CRE approach is negligible, with a MAE that is about 20% to 30% larger than the benchmark.\n\n:::{#tbl-cre tbl-pos="H"} \n\n{{< include simulation/table1.txt >}} \n\nBias and MAE for the estimated marginal effects/Coefficients for non-linear models \n\n:::\n\n\n# Conclusion {#sec-5}\n\nThis paper introduces the `cre` command, a prefix-type command that facilitates the implementation of Correlated Random Effects (CRE) models with a wide range of official and user-written Stata estimation commands. The CRE approach offers a middle ground between fixed effects and random effects models, addressing some of their limitations, particularly in the context of nonlinear model estimation.\n\nAs previously discussed in the literature, our Monte Carlo simulations show that the CRE approach, implemented through the `cre` command, consistently estimates coefficients and marginal effects, performing comparably to the unfeasible estimators that directly control for unobserved factors. The simulations reveal negligible bias, with an increase in the variance of the estimates, which is consistent with theoretical expectations.\n\nThe `cre` command addresses a significant gap in Stata\'s econometric toolkit, providing a user-friendly implementation of CRE models. This tool may prove valuable for researchers working with panel data or nested data structures, where standard fixed effects approaches may be challenging or nonexistent, and random effects assumptions are not appropriate.\n</edited_text>\n\n<change_explanations>\n1.
