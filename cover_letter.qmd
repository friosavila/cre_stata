Dear Editors of the Stata Journal,

I would like submit my manuscript titled "Simplifying the Estimation of Correlated Random Effects Models" for consideration for publication in the Stata Journal. This paper introduces the `cre` command, a tool that aims to simplify the implementation of Correlated Random Effects (CRE) models across a wide range of linear and non-linear estimators.

The CRE approach offers a middle ground between fixed effects and random effects models, addressing some of their limitations. While the implementation of such type of models is easy, I believe the `cre` would further simplify the task, providing a user-friendly and flexible solution for Stata users.

I believe this paper and the accompanying `cre` command will be of significant interest to Stata Journal readers, particularly those working with panel data or nested data structures.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best wishes,

Fernando Rios-Avila
